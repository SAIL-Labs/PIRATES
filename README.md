## PIRATES
Code for PIRATES Image Reconstruction Algorithm

When using please site our paper: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.11950

There are two components to the code provided for the PIRATES Algorithm. 

* PART A) Code to build training data for PIRATES
  * make_MCFOST_model.py - code to generate MCFOST models to train PIRATES on.
  * custom_MCFOST_density.py - collection of adapted files from (https://github.com/alipwong/VAMPIRES-MCFOST-GA)
  * Alison_functions.py - collection of adapted files from (https://github.com/alipwong/VAMPIRES-MCFOST-GA)
  * requirements file is called : requirements_MCFOST.txt
 
To run code in Part A), you will need to install MCFOST (Christophe Pinte) version 4.03 - https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost.
    
* PART B) Code to build and train the PIRATES Algorithm
  * final_runexpt_fitnn_jatis.py - organisational file from which PIRATES is designed and constructed. Handles metadata
  * final_imrfitnn_jatis.py - contains all functions to build, train, iteratively fit and evaluate PIRATES performance
  * requirements file is called : requirements_PIRATES.txt
 
Requirements files are provided for Part A) and Part B), as you may wish to run each component of the package in a unique environment, on different computers. Part A - code to generate training data for PIRATES is best run on a HPC computer with many CPUs. Part B - code to build, train and fit PIRATES is best run on a GPU.
 
We provide the following meta data for the g18 NRM mask:
* interferometric (u,v) coordinates
* the index of the (u,v) coordinates used for closure phase quantities
